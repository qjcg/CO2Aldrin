# COâ‚‚ Aldrin

```
A crisp fizzing sound,
followed by a cool buzz, as
the dark becomes light!
```

A small polyglot programming project.

Consists of:

- code implementing simple tasks in a variety of languages
- a `Dockerfile` for building and running the code

Draws inspiration from the most excellent [Rosetta Code] and [HyperPolyglot]
projects. Unlike in those projects, code included here is not meant to be a
comprehensive resource, but instead is written as a learning exercise.


## Install

Either pull the pre-built image from the public [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/qjcg/co2aldrin/), or clone this repo and
build locally.

Alternatively, compilers and/or interpreters can be installed on your host
machine to run commands directly without `docker`.

### Pull image from Docker Hub

```sh
$ docker pull qjcg/co2aldrin
```

### Build Locally

`cd` into your copy of this repo, and run:

```sh
$ docker build -t qjcg/co2aldrin .
```


## Use

By default, running the docker image will print the result of testing all
commands:

```sh
$ docker run --rm qjcg/co2aldrin
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.awk
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.bash
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.fish
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.js
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.lua
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.php
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.pl
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.py
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.rb
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.tcl
PASSED: /app/bin/fizzbuzz.zsh
```

```sh
$ docker run --rm qjcg/co2aldrin versions
